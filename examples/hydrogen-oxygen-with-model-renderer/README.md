This is a normal Hydrogen app generated by Shopify (full storefront example),
but integrated with Plasmic.

It is ready to deploy to the Oxygen edge runtime. In this repo, this is enabled by the [model renderer](https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/model-renderer-quickstart), which is provided in the @plasmicapp/model-renderer-react package.

The key files to look at are:

- app/routes/plasmic-demo.tsx: the actual demo page showing how to load and render a page from Plasmic.
- app/plasmic-init.ts: the Plasmic loader configuration and code component registrations.
- app/routes/plasmic-host.tsx: the usual app-hosting route for Plasmic.
